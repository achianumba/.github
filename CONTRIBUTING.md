# LinkORB contributing guide 👨‍💻

This document provides general guidelines for making meaningful contributions to LinkORB's projects on GitHub. 

## Getting started 🏇

The _**README.md**_ file at the root of each repository is a great resource for getting started with an existing project. Check it out and read other related documentation if necessary.

## Making changes 🛠


Don't make changes directly to the `main` branch of a project. Clone the repository to your computer or open it in a Codespace and create a new branch (with a 2- to 3-word descriptive name) for that change. 

Review the [Write effective commit messages with a template](https://engineering.linkorb.com/topics/git/articles/commit-template) guide for best for our commit messages conventions.

## Submitting and reviewing changes 🚀

See our [Creating and reviewing pull requests](https://engineering.linkorb.com/topics/git/articles/reviewing-pr/) guide for pull request best practices.

## Testing ⛳

Test all code changes using development and _mock_ production environments to avoid unpleasant surprises.

## Issues 🚧

Don't create a GitHub issue when you find a bug in vulnerability closed source projects. Use one of the following channels instead:

- Create a Cyans topic to discuss next steps
- Create and assign a Team HQ card to team members who can resolve the issue. See [Add a card to a project](https://engineering.linkorb.com/about/culture-handbook/project-cards/#add-a-card-to-a-project) for more information.

LinkORB team members contributing to open source projects, please use the above channels. If you're a third-party contributor, please check that there's no open issue addressing the problem before creating a GitHub issue.

## Documentation ✍

Technical writers, please review LinkORB's [technical documentation standards](https://engineering.linkorb.com/topics/technical-documentation/articles/standards/) before adding or modifying documentation to a project. If the created/modified document is presented on a web page, please run the site locally or in a Codespace to ensure it renders as expected.

## Questions 🙋

Direct your questions about a project to the repository's primary maintainer/contributor or a subject-matter expert. See [Communicate through appropriate channels](https://engineering.linkorb.com/about/culture-handbook/first-day-and-week/#communicate-through-appropriate-channels) and [Asynchronous communications tl;dr](https://engineering.linkorb.com/about/culture-handbook/first-day-and-week/#asynchronous-communications-tldr) for communication best practices.
